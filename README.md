# AI at music - Computers learn composing
This is a project by MatteoFriedrich and me for the Jugend Forscht 2021 competition in Germany. It is capable of creating new, mostly original Jazz music. If you want to know more about it, you can read "paper (German).pdf".

## Installation
Windows or Linux are recommended.
### Windows
Install the zip file from https://github.com/AR102/JuFo2021/releases/tag/v1.0. Move it to a preffered location, unzip it and execute the Batch file ("Neural Jazz.bat"). The first startup may take a while as a few packages have to be installed. An internet connection is necessary.

### MacOS and Linux
Install the Julia programming language (https://julialang.org/downloads/), currently only version 1.5 is tested. Then start it by typing "julia" into your systems terminal. Now navigate to the location of the folder by typing "cd("path/to/Neural Jazz/src"). To start it, type "include("main.jl")". The first startup may take a while as a few packages have to be installed. An internet connection is necessary.
